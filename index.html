							<p>CELINE Men’s Summer Fashion Show 2023 will take place at 4 pm KST on June 26. Netizens and fans are now looking forward to the interactions between V, Lisa, and Park Bo Gum. If the three take pictures together at the show, they promise to take social media by storm.</p>
							
							<blockquote>Lisa raises expectations for her appearance at CELINE’s upcoming fashion show as the brand’s first and only global ambassador.</blockquote>
							<blockquote>V has been a sought-after face by several luxury designer brands, from Louis Vuitton, Gucci, to CELINE. He is expected to be the first BTS member to gain a foothold in the fashion industry, with his overflowing charisma and popularity.</blockquote>
							<blockquote>Having a handsome face and exuding elegance, Park Bo Gum left a good impression when he attended Louis Vuitton Men’s Fall-Winter 2022 fashion show that took place not long ago.
